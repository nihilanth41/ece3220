# ECE3220 

Repo for the portfolio project.   

## Notes 
- In class assignment #2 was handwritten so it's not included. 
- Lab #3 was over Git usage, so the code inside is not meaningful other than showing how commits work. 
 - Additionally, the lab had a specific requirement about the repository name so it doesn't follow the same naming convention.
- ece3220_tetris is the final project.
